/// String-keyed facade over the typed `DOLConfigBridge` setters/getters,
/// for the debug/benchmark HTTP API and automated settings sweeps.
///
/// `DOLConfigBridge` is typed-only (separate `+gfxEfbScale` / `+setGfxEfbScale:`
/// etc.), which a generic `set(key,value)` REST endpoint can't call directly.
/// This bridge maps a stable string key to a pair of get/set blocks that close
/// over the correctly-typed `DOLConfigBridge` call. (Blocks, not
/// `performSelector:`, because the underlying setters take primitives —
/// BOOL / NSInteger / float — which `performSelector:` cannot pass safely.)
///
/// Each key is tagged hot-swappable vs boot-time. A boot-time key only takes
/// effect on the next core boot, so an automated sweep MUST reload the save
/// state / reboot the title after changing one (otherwise the change is a
/// silent no-op and the measured data is garbage).

///   - `value`         : NSNumber or NSString — current value
///   - `type`          : NSString — one of "bool" / "int" / "float" / "string"
///   - `hotSwappable`  : NSNumber(BOOL) — YES if it applies live mid-run
+ (NSDictionary<NSString*, NSDictionary<NSString*, id>*>*)snapshotAll;

/// Apply `value` to `key`. `value` may be an NSNumber (bool/int/float) or
/// NSString depending on the key's type; numeric strings are coerced.
/// Returns NO if the key is unknown. Note: a YES return for a boot-time key
/// means the config was written, NOT that it is live — the caller must reload.
